                    I did study for Design Engineering a couple of years ago, but then I decided to change university to study Web Development.
                    Afterwards, I realised that I'm in love with Front-End Web Development!
                    Unfortunately, I was forced to leave university after the war had started. 
                    Recently I've decided to enroll in the Scrimba Front-End Development Path.
                    My stack includes React JS, Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
                    Also, I know how to work with Figma.

                    Currently, I live in Bremen, Germany.

                    Excluding education, I love to drink a lot of tea, and I have a cat :)
