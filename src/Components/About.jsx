                    I studied Design Engineering a couple of years ago but then decided to switch to studying Web Development at a different university.
                    I soon discovered my love for Front-End Web Development.
                    Unfortunately, I had to leave university due to the outbreak of war.
                    However, I recently decided to enroll in the Scrimba Front-End Development Path to further my skills.
                    My tech stack includes React JS, Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS, and I am proficient in working with Figma.

                    Currently, I live in Bremen, Germany.

                    Outside of education, I enjoy drinking tea and spending time with my cat :)
