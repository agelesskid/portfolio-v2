                    I'm a web developer and currently I live in Bremen, Germany.<br />
                    I did study for Design Engineer couple years ago, but then I decided to change university to study Web Development.
                    Afterwards I realised that I'm in love with <b>Front-End</b> Web Development! <br />
                    Unfotunately, I was forced to leave university after war had started. 
                    A little bit lately i decided to enroll for the Scrimba Front-End Development Path.
                    Currently my stack includes React JS, Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
                    Also, I know how to work with Figma.

                    Excluding education, I love to drink a lot of tea, and I have a cat :)
